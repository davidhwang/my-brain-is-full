                <blockquote>"It is time to come clean: Github is confusing, Git is confusinger, pretty much everything in a modern web stack no longer makes sense to me, and no one explains it well, because they assume I know some fundamental piece of information that everyone takes for granted and no one documented, almost as if it were a secret that spread around to most everyone some time in 2012, yet I some how missed, because—you know—life was happening to me, so I’ve given up on trying to understand, even the parts where I try to comprehend what everyone else is working on that warrants that kind of complexity, and now I fear that this makes me irrelevant, so I nestle close to my story that my value is my “ideas” and capability to “make sense of things,” even though I can’t make sense of any of the above—but really, maybe I’m doing okay, since it’s all too much to know. Let the kids have it."</blockquote>

                <p>Frontend as a mature, separate practice both within Drupal and beyond.</p>

                <p>There is room and demand and need for Frontend engs, everywhere, in Drupal and outside, and ultimately that is where your craft and skills lie, whether you continue to work with Drupal or not.</p>
